# Modern Europe Lectures
This repository is the JSON files that form the presentations for Nathan Michalewicz's Modern Europe class at Queen's University of Charlotte. The course uses Nathan's reactPresentation library to produce React.js website presentations that operate like PowerPoints. Instead, of designing the slides, JSON files are used to describe the slides that are read by the presentation to produce the slides. 

## Unit I Overview
The goal of this unit is to tie together the changes of the early modern period in Europe. There are two main threads:
1. The nominalist, humanist, and global outlook of the Renaissance led to major changes in Europe that flowed into the Scientific Revolution and then the Enlightenment. In the Scientific Revolution, the return-to-the-source mentality of the Renaissance extended to the classics themselves. They read Ptolemy and then looked at the heavens above and recognized that the celestial bodies were not moving as they were supposed to. They sought new models to explain the aberration. But these activities continued to operate and were supported by state and church institutions. During the enlightenment, these approaches to the world left the purview of the state and went to the coffee house, the salon, and the public sphere, which allowed them to question not only the world but also the state.
